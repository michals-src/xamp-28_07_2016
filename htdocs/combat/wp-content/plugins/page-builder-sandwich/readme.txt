= Okay.. What's Unique? =

Most of the time, page builders make you go through a lot of popups just to edit a simple thing. For example, if you want to edit a heading, you'll have to open up a popup, type in a text field, then save and close the popup. With Page Builder Sandwich, it's super easy, just click on your content and start typing. It's so much faster and intuitive.

= No Coding Knowledge Necessary =

Until now, an ordinary person would need a professional developer to build a beautiful website. Not anymore. With our precisely crafted interface and tools, you'll be able to create layouts and designs without knowing a piece of code. You don't even have to learn what the difference between what a margin and what a padding is, it's that beginner friendly.

= Ease of Use =

Using Page Builder Sandwich is unbelievably easy, fast and unlike anything you've used before:

* Click on text and headings and start typing right away
* Type in shortcodes directly to add them, or pick them from a list
* Paste in a URL or an embed code to add videos and other content
* Hit Ctrl+Z / Command+Z to undo mistakes
* Drag content to move it to another location
* Drag images in your browser from your Windows Explorer / Finder to add them
* Pick styles from our inspector to design your page
* Add raw HTML, widgets, sidebars, shortcodes, Google Maps, vector icons, and plenty more

= Stress-Free and Fluid Experience =

We made sure to remove all distractions and hinderances from the flow of editing. Now you can concentrate on creating your design with nothing else holding you back. No more going through multiple popups and filling out fields to edit stuff.

= Use familiar tools to make your site =

Following your intuition is key. Add text, columns, colors, pictures, videos and other design elements using buttons and shortcuts that you already know.

= Site Performance =

We include as little scripts and styles as possible to your site to ensure that everything loads fast. Scripts and styles are only included when you use them.

= Use With Your Current Set Up =

We have successfully used Page Builder Sandwich with a lot of themes including themes from the WordPress.org theme repository, Genesis Themes, StudioPress Themes, Elegant Themes and themes from ThemeForest. If it doesn't work with your theme, please let us know and will fix it.

= Works With Your Existing Content =

Page Builder Sandwich integrates with how WordPress deals with content, so it should work well with your existing pages. Your content should be editable right away in the frontend.
